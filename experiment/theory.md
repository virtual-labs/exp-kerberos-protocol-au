### Theory

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that enables secure communication over an insecure network. It allows clients and servers to prove their identities to each other without transmitting passwords over the network. The protocol relies on a trusted third party—called the **Kerberos Authentication Server (AS)**—to authenticate users and issue **tickets** that grant access to network services.

Kerberos uses **[symmetric key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)**, where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. This approach ensures confidentiality and integrity during communication between clients and servers.

When a user logs in, the following steps occur:

1. **Request for a Ticket**  
   The client sends a request to the Authentication Server (AS), including the user's identity and a timestamp, to access a specific network service.

2. **Authentication Server Response**  
   The AS responds with a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** and a **session key**, both encrypted using the user's password. The **[session key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_key)** is a temporary cryptographic key used to secure communication between the user and the ticket-granting system.

3. **Request for a Service Ticket**  
   The client then sends the TGT and a request for a service ticket to the **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)**.

4. **Service Ticket Response**  
   The TGS validates the TGT and issues a **service ticket**, which contains another session key encrypted using the service’s secret key.

5. **Service Request**  
   The client presents this service ticket to the desired service (e.g., a file server), establishing trust without revealing credentials.

6. **Service Response**  
   The service decrypts the ticket, validates it, and initiates secure communication with the client using the shared session key.

Kerberos provides **mutual authentication**:
- The **client** authenticates to the AS with its credentials.
- The **AS** proves its identity by sending an encrypted TGT.
- The **service** trusts the client because the TGS vouches for it through the ticket.

This protocol is widely used in enterprise environments (notably Microsoft Windows domains) and is known for its security and efficiency.
